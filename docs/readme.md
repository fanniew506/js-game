 # Infinite Runner Game

 ### Background

The infinite runner game is one where the player continuously runs across the screen dodging obstacles for as long as they can.  They lose the game if they come into contact with the obstacle.

 ### Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Start and restart the game
- [ ] Use the keyboard arrow keys to control the game

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An About screen describing the background and rules of the game
- [ ] A production README   

 This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

 Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
 Easel.js with HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering,
 Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

 ### Implementation Timeline

 **Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running and `Easel.js` installed.  Create `webpack.config.js`. Learn the basics of `Easel.js`.

 **Day 2**: Dedicate this day to learning the `Easel.js` API.  Build out the background and the infinite scrolling as the game character runs across the screen.

 **Day 3**: Create the game logic backend.  Build out modular functions for handling the different grid types along with their unique neighbor checks and rule sets.  


 **Day 4**: Install the controls for the user to interact with the game.  Style the frontend, making it polished and professional.  Goals for the day:

 - Create controls for game speed, start, reset
 - Have a styled `Canvas`, nice looking controls and title
